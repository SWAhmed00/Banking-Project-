# Banking-Project-
Uses inheritance and polymorphism 
I have a base class called bank which the checking and savings classes are derived from. This allows me to have two different types of bankings account wihtout having to be redundant in the code
for some of the same variable that apply to both of them. Then for both of the classes I have class specific methods that are used like calculating interest. Lastly I can use 
ploymorphism to treat them as a bank datatype and pass in both types of objects into one function that does the same thing instead of having to have two seperate functions for them.
